## Describing the UI

    - React is Javascript library for rendering user interfaces. User Interfaces built from small units like buttons, text and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components.

### Topics:

    #### Your first component
    ###### React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup.

    #### Importing and exporting components

    ###### You can export a component into its own file, and then import that component from another file.

    #### Writing markup with JSX

    ###### Each React component is JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks alot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information.

    - Note: If you have existing HTML, you can fix it using a converter.
